			<h1> Ink Tank Case Study</h1>
			<h2> Ink Tank is a community app, connecting tattoo artists with those looking to get new ink.</h2>
				<p>
				Ink Tank is a developing app that I designed during a 12 month intensive UX Design course with CareerFoundry. The challenge was to identify an unmet need in the tattoo community to serve as an easy way to connect, share and schedule a session to get a tattoo. I then designed a solution and through many iterations and user tests, I refined a prototype that I feel will best meet the needs of the users.

		</p></div></div>

				<h3>Techniques Used</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>User Surveys and Interviews</li>
						<li>Personas</li>
						<li>Experience Mapping and Site Maps</li>
						<li>Wireframing and Prototyping</li>
						<li>Usability Tesing</li>
						<li>UI Development and Visual Design</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>
				Tattoos are increasingly sought after in popular culture and with the rise of social media, it has never been easier to connect with artists and the tattoo community. Ink Tank is just that, a networking and inspiration sharing playform where users can save and schedule sessions for tattoos they are looking to receive.
				</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			With so many tattoo parlours and artists to choose from, there aren't many tools available for tattoo seekers to narrow down their options. A lot of the apps available serve more as a blog or a professional resume for the artists with less focus on being able to connect with one to schedule a session or get to know their style.
		</p>
	<h3>Solution</h3>
		<p>
			We look to connect the tattoo community with the sole purpose of providing inspiration and access artists based on the criteria selected by the user. Our app acts more like a social network for likeminded people who love tattoos.
		</p>
	<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>
			The Ink Tank App Case Study showcases my work conducting Market Research, User Studies, Test Evaluations and all steps of the UI process including wireframing, site mapping and all levels of fidelity prototyping.
		</p>

	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<h3>Personas</h3>
		<p>
			Based on User Interviews that were conducted, I developed User Personas to encapsulate the primary types of users and encapsulate their main problems and needs. The personas include quotations, demographics, motivations, personality traits and social media apps they frequent most often.
		</p>

	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<p>
			I gathered inspiration from the 2 main competitors in this market, Tattoodo and Inkstinct. Both have a website as well as a mobile app focused solely on tattoos and artists.

			Inkstinct's primary usage is to pull inspiration from various social media platforms and house it in one place. 

			After conducting a Market Profile, S.W.O.T Analysis and a UX Analysis, I was able to idenitfy their Strengths and Opportunities to keep in mind when designing our app.

	</div>


	<h3>Learnings</h3>
		<p>
			The two apps I looked at were heavily influenced by social media to update their content. This allows for a constant stream of fresh images which makes maintaining the site easier and demands less time. Tattoodo was more successful in making booking an appointment easier to access and felt more like it provided a service, whereas Inkstinct felt more like an inspiration board and less about delivering a service.
		</p>

	<h3>Key Insights</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a>Users looking to receive a tattoo seemed unsure of where to begin in terms of finding ideas based on their specifications, how to collaborate with the artist of their choice if they want a custom tattoo, and how to easily schedule a visit with them.</a></li>
			<li><a>Users expressed a desire for a place to save all of the inspiration they gathered, serving as a one-stop profile to access the artists and photos they are using in their haul of inspiration searching.</a></li>
			<li><a>Having to follow artists through external social media accounts is common practice and used expressed a preference to be able to follow an artist within the app to keep their contacts in one place.</a></li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Site Map</h3>
		<p>
			With these notes in mind, I then conducted a card sorting session to determine where our intended users would expect to find certain pages and site actions within the navigation. Using 60 cards and 15 headers, we instructed the partcipants to slot the 60 cards under the header they would expect to find it. We then edited the cards down based on usage and determined the primary functions within the navigation.

	<h2>Define and Ideate</h2>
	<h3>Sketching Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
		<p>
			I initially sketched out the user flows of the main features within the app to translate the actual screens the user would interact with. These rough sketches were then reiterated into mid and high fidelity prototypes used for ongoing usability tests. Based on the expectations from the site map and the results of the card sorting sessions, I was able to determine the main goals of the users and the features they would most benefit from. I then prioritized the most relevant features of the navigation and integrated them into the prototype to test the usability of the feature. 
		</p>
	<h3>Exploring tattoo gallery using the filters</h3>
		<p>
			I designed this interaction in hopes of narrowing down the search of the user in case they are unsure of what they're looking for. This adds an element of discovery upon landing on the page and minimizes friction.

	</div>

	<h3>Booking an appointment with an artist</h3>
		<p>
			The calendar feature within the app is a single place for the user to view all their upcoming appointments and make changes based on their availability.
		</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Viewing favourite artists and saved images</h3>
		<p>
			I gave the user the ability to organize their saved content on their profile to easily access it each time they log into the app, as they expressed this desire in the interviewing stage.
		</p>

	<h2>Define and Ideate</h2>
	<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
	<div>
		<h3>Method</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a>I recruited six participants for a Usability Test based on the Guerrilla method, split between users who have previous experience receiving a tattoo and others who are in the market for their first.</a></li>
				<li><a>I then conducted moderated in person tests where I asked the users to perform a series of tasks using the mid fidelity wireframes that were developed.</a></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Measure of Success</h3>
			<p>
				The success rate of each task will determine the usability of the feature. The success percentage will be determined off the following equasion: (S +(P x .5))/task attempt total = success rate %.

				Where each result falls in terms of priority will then be determined by Jacob Nielsen's rating scale:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a>0 = I don't agree this is a usability problem at all.</a></li>
				<li><a>1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on the project.</a></li>
				<li><a>2 = Minor usability problemL: fixing this should be given low priority.</a></li>
				<li><a>3 = Major usability problem: important to fix and should be given high priority.</a></li>
				<li><a>4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to be fixed before product can be released.</a></li>
			</ul>
		
	</div>

	<h3>Tasks</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><a>You've downloaded the app for yourself and you are excited to start getting inspiration for your next tattoo. In order for you to join the community, you must create an account. So please create an account for yourself within the app.</a></li>
			<li><a>Now that you're a member, find a tattoo that you could see yourself getting in the future. Once you've found the one you want, save that image so you can come back to it later.</a></li>
			<li><a>In order to get this tattoo, you must find an artist to apply it. Find an artist that appeals to you and save them so you can return to their profile later.</a></li>
			<li><a>You now have some ideas of what you want but you stepped away and returned to find you've been logged out. You've forgotten your password, so please reset it and proceed to log in.</a></li>
			<li><a>Now that you've logged back in, locate the saved content from earlier.</a></li>
			<li><a>Contact the artist you saved and attach the saved image as a reference to what you're hoping they can do.</a></li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
		<p>
			Based on the previous sketches and results from the user tests, I then developed the mid fidelity wireframes to address the problems the user was experiencing in the navigation and to best communicate the visual direction the app is evolving to look like.
		</p>

				<img class="research" src="img/inktank/midmobile.jpg" alt="page12">
		</picture>
	</div>

	<h3>A/B Testing</h3>
		<p>
			Data and feedback from again conducting usability tests on the Mid-Fidenlity prototype, once it was collected and analysed, I identified the most important test results. This data was then used in applying some UI elements to the app and two final prototypes were delivered. The same participants from the user tests were then asked to contribute their opinion to an A/B test to determine which landing page they preferred. 

			Option B was the most popular with 80% choosing it based on the layout. When asked to elaborate on their choices we learned that the tone of option A was preferred but they chose option B for the familiarity of the layout.

	</div>

	<h3>Designing the UI</h3>
		<p>
			With this feedback in mind I continued with the layout that felt most intuitive to the user but incorporated the warm tones of option A in the A/B test. This helped shape the images for the other pages since the landing page established the mood of the brand.
		</p>

	<h3>High-fidelity Prototypes</h3>
