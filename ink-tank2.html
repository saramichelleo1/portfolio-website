					<h1> Lotz Case Study</h1>
						<h2> Lotz is a mobile first app that allows users to time share parking spaces.</h2>

				<h3>Techniques Used</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>User Surveys and Interviews</li>
						<li>Personas</li>
						<li>Experience Mapping and Site Maps</li>

				<h3>Context</h3>
					<p>
						The share economy is one of the most profitable areas of business and one of the least saturated. Airbnb owns the space sharing space, Uber and Lyft dominate the ride sharing space, but there has yet to be a leader in the parking space sharing arena. Lots is the solution to that, providing commuters with more convenient and affordable parking solutions while giving land owners with vacant spots a stream of passive income.

				<h3>Challenge</h3>
					<p>
						Toronto is a difficult place to park. On the average work day, public parking lots and street parking are full, while steps away there are vacant private parking spaces that could be better utilized during peak hours. Filling these spots in the time the owners are away would not only reduce congestion in the city but also reduce the costs commuters pay in parking and serve as a passive income to land owners.

				<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>
						We look to connect the tattoo community with the sole purpose of providing inspiration and access artists based on the criteria selected by the user. Our app acts more like a social network for likeminded people who love tattoos.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-5">
				<h3>My Role</h3>
					<p>
						I was the Lead UX/UI Designer and Business Strategist and Researcher on this project.

						With no successful competitiors in this space, a lot of research and testing went into ensuring that this product would be profitable. Where other apps can look to competitors and understand the market based on a SWOT analysis, this sort of research was less impactful given that the only other apps similar were under-developed. In the end though, this meant our product was better researched and ultimately ended up with an app that was simple, attainable and effectively branded.

	<h2>Discovery</h2>

	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-7">
				<h3>Personas</h3>
					<p>
						I developed a User Persona who would serve as both a land owner looking to rent their space and also that same owner in need of parking at their place of work. Our average user is between the ages of 25-40, working full time and of middle income. They work full time and can afford a vehicle in the city and turn to digital apps like ours to make their lives easier where possible.

				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						I gathered inspiration from the 2 main competitors in this market, Honk and Rover. Both are mobile driven parking apps but both have a small reach in our region.

						After conducting a Market Profile, S.W.O.T Analysis and a UX Analysis, I was able to idenitfy their Strengths and Opportunities to keep in mind when designing our app.

				<h3>Learnings</h3>
					<p>
						The two apps I looked at have little presence in the GTA where we are focusing our reach. Honk has more engagement online and more downloads but isn't prominent in our region and Rover is most comparible to our product but is very under-developed and rough around the edges.

				<h3>Empathy Map</h3>
					<p>
						To better understand the use cases of the app for our user, I developed an Empathy Map based on the user research and interviews that were conducted.

				<h3>Sketching Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
					<p>
						I initially sketched out the user flows of the main features within the app to translate the actual screens the user would interact with. These rough sketches were then reiterated into mid and high fidelity prototypes used for ongoing usability tests. Based on the expectations from the site map and the results of the card sorting sessions, I was able to determine the main goals of the users and the features they would most benefit from. I then prioritized the most relevant features of the navigation and integrated them into the prototype to test the usability of the feature.

				<h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
					<p>
